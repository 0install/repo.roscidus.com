  <summary xml:lang="en">GetText: library and tools for native language support</summary>
  <description xml:lang="en">A well integrated set of tools and documentation to help programmers, translators, and users make other GNU packages produce multi-lingual messages. The tools include a set of conventions about how programs should be written to support message catalogs, a directory and file naming organzation for those message catalogs, a runtime library that supports retrieval of translated messages, and a few stand-alone programs to manipulate sets of strings. A special GNU Emacs mode also helps work with these strings. 

Libintl is a library that provides native language support to programs. It is part of Gettext. 
•LibIntl-1 is in Gettext-0.10-.. 
•LibIntl-2 is in Libintl-0.11-.. 
•LibIntl-3 is in LibIntl-0.14-.. and in Gettext-0.14-..
