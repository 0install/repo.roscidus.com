  <summary>fast, scalable, distributed revision control system</summary>
  <description>
Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large projects
with speed and efficiency; it is used mainly for various open source projects,
most notably the Linux kernel.

Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools. Every Git
working directory is a full-fledged repository with full revision tracking
capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.

This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision tree
visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web interface, is
provided as separate git* packages.</description>
