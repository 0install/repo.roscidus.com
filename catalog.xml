Developed for more than 20 years at Inria it benefits from one of the most advanced type systems and supports functional, imperative and object-oriented styles of programming.

    This is the runtime package. It contains the bytecode interpreter (ocamlrun) and the toplevel (ocaml), which allows dynamic linking. It also includes the standard library, plus the Dynlink, Bigarray, Str and Unix extra libraries. Note: only changes to the last version component are binary compatible (e.g. 4.00.1 and 4.00.2 are compatible with each other, but not with 4.01.0).</description></interface><interface uri="http://repo.roscidus.com/games/openttd"><name>OpenTTD</name><summary>Open Source clone of Transport Tycoon Deluxe</summary><description>

Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large projects
with speed and efficiency; it is used mainly for various open source projects,
most notably the Linux kernel.

Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools. Every Git
working directory is a full-fledged repository with full revision tracking
capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.

This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision tree
visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web interface, is
provided as separate git* packages.</description><category>Development</category></interface><interface uri="http://repo.roscidus.com/devel/gcc-c"><name>gcc-c</name><summary>gcc C compiler</summary><description/><homepage>https://gcc.gnu.org/</homepage></interface><interface uri="http://repo.roscidus.com/devel/glade"><name>Glade</name><summary>a User Interface Designer</summary><description>
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user interfaces for
the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.

The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using the
GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications dynamically as
needed.

By using GtkBuilder, Glade XML files can be used in numerous programming
languages including C, C++, C#, Vala, Java, Perl, Python,and others.</description><homepage>http://glade.gnome.org/</homepage><category>Development</category><icon href="http://glade.gnome.org/images/glade.png" type="image/png"/></interface><interface uri="http://repo.roscidus.com/devel/make"><name>make</name><summary>The GNU version of the &quot;make&quot; utility.</summary><description>

Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating
system. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on
Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh,
which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.

Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features from the
Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a conformant
implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of the IEEE POSIX
specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers functional improvements over sh
for both interactive and programming use.

Since bash is included on most Unix systems, this feed is mainly useful for
Windows systems, where it provides a binary of win-bash (http://win-
bash.sourceforge.net/).</description><homepage>http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/</homepage><category>Utility</category></interface><interface uri="http://repo.roscidus.com/utils/graphviz"><name>graphviz</name><summary>Open Source Graph Visualization Software</summary><description>

    Whoosh is a fast, featureful full-text indexing and searching library
    implemented in pure Python. Programmers can use it to easily add search
    functionality to their applications and websites. Every part of how Whoosh
    works can be extended or replaced to meet your needs exactly.

    Some of Whoosh's features include:

    * Pythonic API.
    * Pure-Python. No compilation or binary packages needed, no mysterious crashes.
    * Fielded indexing and search.
    * Fast indexing and retrieval -- faster than any other pure-Python, scoring,
    full-text search solution I know of.
    * Pluggable scoring algorithm (including BM25F), text analysis, storage,
    posting format, etc.
    * Powerful query language.
    * Pure Python spell-checker (as far as I know, the only one). 

    Whoosh might be useful in the following circumstances:

    * Anywhere a pure-Python solution is desirable to avoid having to build/compile
    native libraries (or force users to build/compile them).
    * As a research platform (at least for programmers that find Python easier to
    read and work with than Java ;)
    * When an easy-to-use Pythonic interface is more important to you than raw
    speed. 

    Whoosh was created and is maintained by Matt Chaput. It was originally created
    for use in the online help system of Side Effects Software's 3D animation
    software Houdini. Side Effects Software Inc. graciously agreed to open-source
    the code.
