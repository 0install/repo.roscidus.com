  <summary>MIT Kerberos runtime libraries</summary>
  <description>Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
Kerberos is a trusted third-party service. That means that there is a
third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
the network (users and services, usually called &quot;principals&quot;).

This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.

This package contains the runtime libraries used by applications and
Kerberos clients.</description>
