  <summary xml:lang="en">A program and library for data compression</summary>
  <description xml:lang="en">bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors), whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression. The code is organised as a library, with a programming interface. The bzip2 program itself is a client of the library. You can use the library in your own programs, to directly read and write .bz2 files, or even just to compress data in memory using the bzip2 algorithms.</description>

    <summary xml:lang="en">a block-sorting file compressor, v1.0.4</summary>
    <description xml:lang="en">bzip2 compresses files using the  Burrows-Wheeler  block
       sorting  text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.
       Compression is generally considerably better  than  that
       achieved  by  more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compres-
       sors, and approaches the performance of the  PPM  family
       of statistical compressors.</description>
